# @name: Python Component Installer
# @description: Installs Python via Miniconda with essential packages for data science and academic work
# @category: Python
# @requires: macOS, Internet connection, Homebrew (will be installed if missing)
# @usage: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtudk/pythonsupport-scripts/main/MacOS/Components/Python/install.sh)"
# @example: PYTHON_VERSION_PS=3.11 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtudk/pythonsupport-scripts/main/MacOS/Components/Python/install.sh)"
# @notes: Uses master utility system for consistent error handling and logging. Script automatically installs Homebrew if not present. Supports multiple Python versions via PYTHON_VERSION_PS environment variable. Creates conda environments and installs essential data science packages.
