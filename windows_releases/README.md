## For Developers

These batch files are wrappers around the main PowerShell installer at `Windows/install.ps1`. They:

1. Set appropriate parameters for different course levels
2. Handle basic error checking and user feedback
3. Provide a user-friendly interface for non-technical users
4. Can be easily customized for specific course requirements

### Customizing for Your Course

To create a custom installer:
1. Copy `install_first_year.bat` to `install_your_course.bat`
2. Modify the package list in the PowerShell command
3. Update the description and echo statements
4. Test thoroughly before distribution

## Security Note

These scripts download and execute code from the internet. They use HTTPS and verify the source, but users should only run installers from trusted sources like the official DTU Python Support repository.
