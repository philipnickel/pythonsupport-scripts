# Parallel Development Plan - Focused

## Worker 1: macOS Platform Specialist
**Goal: Enhance macOS installer with parallel downloads, uninstall feature, and native UX**

### Phase 1: Parallel Downloads Implementation
- **Task 1A:** Implement parallel download system for Python and VSCode
  - Research and implement concurrent download library (curl, wget, or native)
  - Add progress indicators for multiple downloads
  - Handle download failures gracefully with retry logic
  - Ensure downloads don't interfere with each other

### Phase 2: Uninstall Feature Development
- **Task 1C:** Create comprehensive uninstall script
  - Remove Python/conda installations completely
  - Uninstall VSCode and all extensions
  - Clean up shell profile modifications
  - Remove any created directories and files
  - Handle partial installations gracefully

- **Task 1D:** Add uninstall verification
  - Verify all components are properly removed
  - should work when oneliner for uninstall script is executed AND when run withing main installer entrypoint

### Phase 3: Native macOS User Experience
- **Task 1E:** Implement no-terminal user experience
  - Create native macOS dialog boxes for user interactions

- **Task 1F:** Enhance user interface
  - Add installation customization options
  - Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Create installation summary and next steps

### Success Criteria (Worker 1)
- Python and VSCode download simultaneously with progress indicators
- Complete uninstall feature removes all traces of installation
- Users can install without ever seeing terminal
- Native macOS look and feel throughout the process

## Worker 2: Windows Platform Specialist
**Goal: Create complete Windows equivalent to macOS installer**

### Phase 1: Windows Core Implementation
- **Task 2A:** Port macOS installer logic to PowerShell
  - Study existing macOS installer structure and logic
  - Create equivalent PowerShell functions for each macOS component
  - Implement Windows-specific package management (conda/miniforge)
  - Adapt shell profile management for Windows (PowerShell profiles)

- **Task 2B:** Windows-specific adaptations
  - Handle Windows registry modifications
  - Implement Windows PATH environment variable management
  - Create Windows equivalent of shell configuration
  - Adapt file system operations for Windows conventions

### Phase 2: Windows User Experience
- **Task 2C:** Implement Windows native dialogs
  - Create PowerShell-based GUI dialogs for user interactions
  - Add Windows-style progress indicators
  - Implement Windows notification system integration
  - Design Windows-native installation wizard

- **Task 2D:** Windows-specific features
  - Handle Windows Defender and antivirus interactions
  - Implement Windows user account control (UAC) handling
  - Add Windows-specific error handling and recovery
  - Create Windows service integration if needed

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- **Task 2E:** Cross-platform compatibility testing
  - Test on Windows 10 and Windows 11
  - Verify with different Windows user permission levels
  - Test with various Windows configurations
  - Ensure feature parity with macOS version

- **Task 2F:** Integration and documentation
  - Create Windows installation documentation
  - Add Windows-specific troubleshooting guides
  - Implement Windows uninstall feature (mirroring Worker 1's work)
  - Create Windows installation verification tools

### Success Criteria (Worker 2)
- Windows installer provides identical functionality to macOS version
- Same user experience and feature set across platforms
- Proper Windows integration and native feel
- Complete documentation and testing coverage

## Shared Coordination Points

### Critical Dependencies
- **Task 1A + Task 2A:** Coordinate download mechanisms for consistency
- **Task 1C + Task 2F:** Share uninstall logic and patterns
- **Task 1E + Task 2C:** Coordinate user experience design principles

### Shared Infrastructure
- **Configuration Management:** Shared config files for both platforms
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error codes and messages
- **Logging:** Unified logging format across platforms
- **Testing:** Shared test scenarios and validation criteria

### Communication Requirements
- **Weekly Sync:** Share progress and coordinate on shared components
- **Code Reviews:** Cross-review platform-specific implementations
- **Documentation:** Shared documentation standards and templates
- **Release Planning:** Coordinate release timing and feature parity
